# HIFIS-Surveyval

This project is used to develop analysis scripts for the HIFIS Software survey.

## Getting Started

The project's documentation contains a section to help you as a 
[user of the analysis scripts](#getting-for-users) 
to run the analysis scripts or as a 
[developer of the framework](#getting-started-for-developers)
to set up the development environment.

### Getting Started for Users

#### Installation

To install the package locally, you can use 
[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```shell
pip install hifis-surveyval
```

After the installation, you can use the tool from the command line with 
`hifis-surveyval --help`.

### Getting Started for Developers

#### Installation

To install the package locally, you can use 
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

#### Using Poetry

If you want to actively contribute changes to the project, you are required to
also install the development packages alongside the framework.

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.hzdr.de/hifis/surveys/hifis-surveyval.git
cd hifis-surveyval
poetry install
```

After the installation, you can use the tool from the command line with 
`poetry run hifis-surveyval --help`

Poetry installs some packages that are required for performing quality checks.
Usually they are also performed via GitLab CI, but can also be executed locally.

It is common practice to run some checks locally before pushing them online.
Therefore, execute below commands:
```console
$ # Order your imports
$ isort -rc .
$ make lint
```

The following documentation references the pip installation.
You can use the same commands with a poetry installation, if you prefix your 
commands with `poetry run COMMAND`.

## Start Analysis from Command-Line-Interface

The survey analysis package is a program to be executed on the
Command-Line-Interface (CLI).

### Quick Start Example: Run Analysis

Due to sensible defaults of the project's configurations you need to have the 
analysis scripts as well as metadata and data files in certain locations
in order to run the survey analysis.
Please put your analysis scripts into a sub-folder called _scripts_.
Make sure that the file _meta.yml_ is put into sub-folder _metadata_.
Finally, copy the data-CSV-file for example from the 
[wiki page](https://gitlab.hzdr.de/hifis/survey-about-current-development-practice/-/wikis/home) 
of the associated GitLab project 
[Survey about current Development Practice](https://gitlab.hzdr.de/hifis/survey-about-current-development-practice)
into a central location like a _data_ sub-folder and tell the program the 
path to that data file.

Now you can do the following to start the survey analysis from the CLI:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval analyze data/<data_file_name>.csv
```

The output is then put into a sub-folder within the folder _output_ 
which is named after the stamp of the current date-time if not specified 
differently.

**Caution:** 
Depending on the Operating System used an issue with the file 
encoding might occur.
There might be data-CSV-files around which are encoded with `UTF-8-BOM`
which causes errors when read in on Windows OS.
In this case you need to change the encoding to `UTF-8` before running
the survey analysis.

### Flags

The program accepts two flags:

1. Help flag
2. Verbosity flag

#### Help flag

Calling the program with the _help_-flag is the first thing to do
when being encountered with this program.
It outputs a so-called _Usage_-message to the CLI:

```shell script
$ hifis-surveyval --help
```

Please issue this command on the CLI and read the detailed 
_Usage_-message before continuing with reading the documentation
of the _Usage_-message here.

#### Verbosity flag

The _verbosity_-flag can be provided in order to specify the verbosity
of the output to the CLI.
This flag is called `--verbose` or `-v` for short:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval --verbose <COMMAND>
```
```shell script
hifis-surveyval -v <COMMAND>
```

The verbosity of the output can be increased even more 
by duplicating the flag `--verbose` or `-v` up to two times:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval --verbose --verbose --verbose <COMMAND>
```
```shell script
hifis-surveyval -vvv <COMMAND>
```

### Commands

There are three different commands implemented which come with its own set of
flags and parameters:

1. Command _version_
2. Command _init_
3. Command _analyze_

#### Command _version_
 
The `version` command outputs the version number of this CLI-program like so:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval version
```

#### Command _init_

Before you start the analysis you may want to change the defaults of the
configuration variables.
In order to do so, you can create a configuration file that is named 
_hifis-surveyval.yml_ by issuing the _init_ command:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval init
```

This file contains the following information:

```
METADATA: metadata/meta.yml
OUTPUT_FOLDER: output
OUTPUT_FORMAT: PNG
SCRIPT_FOLDER: scripts
SCRIPT_NAMES: []
```

First of all, each analysis needs metadata about the questions asked in the
survey and answers that participants may give.
This metadata file is by default located in a folder called _metadata_
and named _meta.yml_.

Second, you may specify the output folder which is named _output_ by default.

Third, you may prefer a specific output format like _PDF_, _PNG_, _SVG_ or 
_SCREEN_.
The default value is _PNG_.
Note: Be aware that other output formats like text or markdown files may be 
created, which depends largely upon the implementation of the analysis scripts.

Fourth, you may specify the folder which contains the analysis scripts, which
is the _scripts_ folder by default.

Finally, you may select a subset of the analysis scripts available as a list
that ought to be executed.
This list is empty by default, which means, all scripts are executed.

#### Command _analyze_

The more interesting command is the `analyze` command
which comes with a _data_-parameter.
The _data_-parameter can _not_ be omitted and need to be given explicitly
in order to be able to start the analysis.
This is an example of how to do the analysis:

```shell script
hifis-surveyval analyze data/<data_file_name>.csv
```

## Contribute with Own Analysis Scripts

### Essential Requirements for Developing Own Analysis Scripts

As you might have read in the previous sections the actual analysis scripts 
reside in a specific folder called `scripts`.
All scripts in that folder will be automatically discovered by the package 
`hifis-surveyval` when running the analysis.
In order that the program recognizes the scripts in that folder as
analysis scripts they need to fulfill the following two criteria:

1. The filename need to end on `.py`.
2. The file need to contain a function called `run` without any parameters.

```python
"""
A dummy script for testing the function dispatch

.. currentmodule:: hifis_surveyval.scripts.dummy
.. moduleauthor:: HIFIS Software <software@hifis.net>
"""

def run():
    print("Example Script")
```

If both requirements are satisfied the program will execute the `run`-functions
of the analysis scripts in an arbitrary order.
